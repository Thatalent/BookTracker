{"description": "Harry Potter #3\r\n\r\nFor Harry Potter, it\u2019s the start of another far-from-ordinary year at Hogwarts when the Knight Bus crashes through the darkness and comes to an abrupt halt in front of him.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that Sirius Black, mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort, has escaped \u2013 and they say he is coming after Harry.\r\n\r\nIn his first Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry\u2019s tea leaves.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps most frightening of all are the Dementors patrolling the school grounds with their soul-sucking kiss \u2013 in search of fresh victims.\r\n\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.jkrowling.com/book/harry-potter-prisoner-azkaban/", "links": [{"url": "https://www.jkrowling.com/book/harry-potter-prisoner-azkaban/", "title": "jkrowling.com/book/harry-potter-prisoner-azkaban/", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}}, {"title": "Wikipedia page", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}}], "title": "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", "covers": [10580435, 8259337, 8125745, 1048188, 8465096, 10196463, 10447843, 10470763, 10509997, 10515103, 10368528, -1], "subject_places": ["England", "Azkaban", "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (Imaginary place)"], "subjects": ["fantasy fiction", "orphans", "foster homes", "fantasy", "literature", "juvenile fantasy fiction", "Locus Award winner", "Bram Stoker Award winner", "Whitbread Book Award winner", "Adventure", "Juvenile literature", "Juvenile works", "Juvenile audience", "Children's books", "Magic", "Open Library Staff Picks", "Juvenile fiction", "Wizards", "New York Times bestseller", "Schools", "nyt:series_books=2006-09-16", "Science Fiction, Fantasy, & Magic", "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (Imaginary place)", "Witches", "Harry Potter (Fictitious character)", "Ficci\u00f3n juvenil", "Magos", "Magia", "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (Imaginary organization)", "Children's Books/Ages 9-12 Fiction", "Spanish: Grades 4-7", "General", "Potter, Harry (Fictitious character)", "Potter, Harry (Caracter ficticio)", "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (Lugar imaginario)", "Escuelas", "Spanish language", "Literatura juvenil", "Harry Potter (Fictional character)", "Orphans & Foster Homes", "Fantasy & Magic", "French language materials", "School stories", "Family", "Fiction", "Social Themes", "Friendship", "Reading Level-Grade 9", "Reading Level-Grade 11", "Reading Level-Grade 10", "Reading Level-Grade 12", "Translations from English", "Chinese language materials", "England", "Chinese fiction", "Tong hua", "England, fiction", "Potter, harry (fictitious character), fiction", "Schools, fiction", "Children's fiction", "Wizards, fiction", "Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry (imaginary organization), fiction", "Magic, fiction", "Fiction, fantasy, general", "Magie", "Magiciens", "Schulferien", "Deutschland", "Verrat", "Freundschaft", "Romans, nouvelles, etc. pour la jeunesse", "Junge", "Good and evil", "Jugendgruppe", "Fabeltiere", "L\u00fcge", "Rache", "Boarding schools", "Deutschland Grenzschutzkommando Mitte Schule", "Potter, Harry (Personnage fictif)", "English literature", "Bengali Detective and mystery stories", "Hermione Granger (Fictitious character)", "Ron Weasley (Fictitious character)", "Large type books", "Juvenile films", "Pel\u00edculas cinematogr\u00e1ficas juveniles", "Hechiceros", "Potter, Harry (Personaje literario)"], "subject_people": ["Harry Potter", "Hermione Granger", "Ron Weasley", "Sirius Black", "Albus Dumbledore", "Lord Voldemort", "Professor Trelawney", "Harry Potter (Fictitious character)", "Hermine Granger", "Ron Weasly"], "key": "/works/OL82566W", "authors": [{"author": {"key": "/authors/OL23919A"}, "type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}}], "excerpts": [{"comment": "first sentence", "author": {"key": "/people/seabelis"}, "excerpt": "Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways."}], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "first_publish_date": "1999", "latest_revision": 38, "revision": 38, "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-10-17T07:07:29.461716"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2021-04-25T12:59:31.436595"}}
