When Mitch McDeere signed on with Bendini, Lambert & Locke of Memphis, he thought he and his beautiful wife, Abby, were on their way. The firm leased him a BMW, paid off his school loans, arranged a mortgage and hired him a decorator. Mitch McDeere should have remembered what his brother Ray \u2014 doing fifteen years in a Tennessee jail \u2014 already knew. You never get nothing for nothing. Now the FBI has the lowdown on Mitch\u2019s firm and needs his help. Mitch is caught between a rock and a hard place, with no choice \u2014 if he wants to live.\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in:\r\n\r\n - [Novels (Firm / Pelican Brief)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL76969W)\r\n - [Reader's Digest Condensed Books.
