{"first_publish_date": "July 1, 2003", "description": "The play concerns a trusted general who secretly lusts for power. Encouraged by the prophecies of three witches and urged on by his ambitious wife Macbeth commits regicide. Left fearful and superstitious by this desperate act he is driven to a spiralling course of murder and outrage, almost inevitably culminating in his own death. One of Shakespeare\u2019s most popular tragedies, Macbeth is ostensibly based on the Scottish king although the story represented in the play bears no relation to historical fact as the true King Macbeth was well respected by his contemporaries. This book includes the hero Macbeth becoming more and more evil after he gets told his \"destiny\" by the witches and becomes greedy with power.", "title": "Macbeth", "covers": [7424001, 8348595, 3333112, 2242905, 6281740, 7826502, 8537349, 9006135, 10396898, 1958064], "first_sentence": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Thunder and lightning.
