{"description": "Frodo and the Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in the battle with an evil spirit in the Mines of Moria; and at the Falls of Rauros, Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape the rest of the company were attacked by Orcs. Now they continue their journey alone down the great River Anduin \u2013 alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go. J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s great work of imaginative fiction has been labelled both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely, epic and diabolic, the narrative moves through countless changes of scene and character in an imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Also contained in:**\r\n\r\n - [The Lord of the Rings][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL27448W/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "links": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Towers", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "The Two Towers - Wikipedia"}, {"url": "http://www.tolkienestate.com/en/writing/tales-of-middle-earth/the-lord-of-the-rings.html", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "Tolkien Estate | The Lord of the Rings"}], "title": "The Two Towers", "covers": [8167231, 8478177, 10290014, 10290863, 10290894, 10293430, 10291553, 10293564, 10290886, 10457086, -1], "subject_places": ["Middle Earth (Imaginary place)", "Tierra Media", "River Anduin", "Middle Earth", "Minas Tirith", "Rohan", "Fangorn Forrest", "Moria", "Edoras", "Helm's Deep", "Isengard", "Gondor", "Mount Doom", "Ithilien", "Dead Marshes"], "first_publish_date": "October 1999", "subject_people": ["Gandalf", "Frodo Baggins", "Aragorn II", "Merry", "Pippin", "Samwise", "Boromir", "Saruman the White", "Uruk-hai", "Sauron", "Shelob", "Legolas", "Gimli", "Huorns", "Gollum", "\u00c9omer", "Gr\u00edma Wormtongue", "the Balrog", "Treebeard", "Rohirrim", "Th\u00e9oden"], "key": "/works/OL27479W", "authors": [{"type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}, "author": {"key": "/authors/OL26320A"}}], "excerpts": [{"comment": "first sentence", "excerpt": "ARAGORN sped on up the hill.", "author": {"key": "/people/seabelis"}}], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "subjects": ["Ents", "Orcs", "hobbits", "magic", "Ficci\u00f3n fant\u00e1stica inglesa", "Ficci\u00f3n", "translations into Spanish", "readers for new literates", "The Lord of the Rings", "English Fantasy fiction", "Open Library Staff Picks", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Popular Carousel", "Middle Earth (Imaginary place)", "Tierra Media (Lugar imaginario)", "Baggins, Frodo (Personaje literario)", "Chinese language materials", "Translations into Chinese", "English fiction", "Frodo Baggins (Fictitious character)", "Fantasy fiction", "Adventure fiction", "Fiction, fantasy, epic", "Middle earth (imaginary place), fiction", "Baggins, frodo (fictitious character), fiction", "Gandalf (fictitious character), fiction", "Fantasmes", "Roman fantastique", "Spanish: Adult Nonfiction", "Large type books"], "first_sentence": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "ARAGORN sped on up the hill."}, "latest_revision": 45, "revision": 45, "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-10-13T02:46:28.838662"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2021-04-10T08:24:46.944611"}}
